# Truffle

Truffle is a testing framework and asset pipeline for blockchains using the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), aiming to make life as a developer easier. With Truffle, you get:

> Built-in smart contract compilation, linking, deployment and binary management.
> Automated contract testing for rapid development.
> Scriptable, extensible deployment & migrations framework.
> Network management for deploying to any number of public & private networks.
> Package management with EthPM & NPM, using the ERC190 standard.
> Interactive console for direct contract communication.
> Configurable build pipeline with support for tight integration.
> External script runner that executes scripts within a Truffle environment.

In simple language, get your smart contracts tested before deployed using truffle so that you can save real money
