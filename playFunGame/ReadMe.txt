This File belongs to playFunGame contract.....

Issues:

Unable to use msg.sender in truffle while testing, So I made assignment for second player.

Require is causing some issues like 
* Error: VM Exception while processing transaction: invalid opcode
* Error: VM Exception while processing transaction: revert.

To get rid of these errors i created instance of the contract within the test case.
